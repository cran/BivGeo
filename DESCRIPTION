Description: Provides functions to compute the joint probability mass function (pmf), cumulative distribution function (cdf), and survival function (sf) of the Basu-Dhar bivariate geometric distribution. Additional functionalities include the calculation of the correlation coefficient, covariance, and cross-factorial moments, as well as the generation of random variates. The package also implements parameter estimation based on the method of moments.
